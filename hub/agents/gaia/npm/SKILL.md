# Integrating `@amd-gaia/gaia`

`@amd-gaia/gaia` delivers **two binaries** and owns their process lifecycle: the
frozen **agent sidecar** (`gaia-agent`) and the Go **terminal UI** (`gaia-tui`).
It ships no agent logic of its own, and it **builds neither binary at install
time** — both are published artifacts it downloads and verifies. The terminal UI
is the published `terminal-hub` component, the same binary a full GAIA install
runs as `gaia tui`, so its behaviour cannot differ from that one. Everything runs on the local machine against
a local model server — nothing you type or index leaves it.

Two ways in:

- **`npx @amd-gaia/gaia`** — fetch, verify, launch the terminal UI. What a human runs.
- **The programmatic exports** — fetch, spawn the sidecar, drive `POST /v1/gaia/query`
  yourself. What you use when embedding GAIA in an app.

> **This file is NOT one of the agent's own skills.** It is the integration
> playbook: how *you* wire this package into an app. The agent separately loads
> **Agent Skills** into its own prompt at runtime from
> `gaia_agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Same filename, different artifact —
> don't ship this one as an agent skill. See
> [Skills](#10-skills--one-always-on-the-rest-opt-in).

## 1. Install

```bash
npx @amd-gaia/gaia          # no install step; fetches what it needs on first run
npm install @amd-gaia/gaia  # when you want the programmatic exports
```

The package is **ESM-only** (`"type": "module"`) and needs **Node 18+** for the
built-in `fetch`. Use `import`, not `require`; from CommonJS use
`await import("@amd-gaia/gaia")`.

> `@amd-gaia/gaia` **publishes with this release** — it is not on npm yet. Until
> the release tag lands, `npx @amd-gaia/gaia` will not resolve. Run the agent from
> a source checkout in the meantime (see
> [the guide](https://amd-gaia.ai/docs/guides/gaia)).

## 2. What `npx @amd-gaia/gaia` actually does

1. Resolves the host platform key (`` `${process.platform}-${process.arch}` ``).
2. Reads `binaries.lock.json`, the checksum manifest published with this exact
   package version. Each component records its own hub lane, version, artifact
   name and hash — they do not share a base URL.
3. Downloads **both** binaries, each from its own lane, and **SHA-256 verifies
   each against the lock**.
4. Installs the sidecar into `~/.gaia/agents/gaia/` and the TUI into
   `~/.gaia/npm-cache/gaia-<version>/`.
5. Writes `~/.gaia/agents/gaia/.installed` — the record the daemon and the TUI
   both read to decide the sidecar is installed. Written on a cache hit too, so
   an install staged by an earlier release repairs itself.
6. Execs the TUI, whose exit code becomes ours.

`run` deliberately does **not** spawn a sidecar. The TUI reaches agents through
the GAIA daemon's relay and never holds a sidecar token, and the daemon is what
spawns and supervises the sidecar — from exactly the directory step 4 wrote to.
A second sidecar started here would only fight the daemon's own for port 8141. Use
`gaia serve` when you want to own the process.

Other commands: `gaia fetch` (download + verify, print JSON, exit),
`gaia serve` (sidecar alone), `gaia version` (per-component version, source URL,
and platform matrix). Anything after a bare `--` goes to the TUI verbatim.

### Where each binary comes from

| Component | Hub lane                                  | Artifact names            |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `sidecar` | `agents/gaia/<agentVersion>/`             | `gaia-agent-<platformKey>[.exe]` |
| `tui`     | `agents/terminal-hub/<componentVersion>/` | `gaia-<goPlatform>[.exe]` |

Two things follow from that, and both bite if you assume otherwise:

- **The two components version independently.** `lock.agentVersion` is this
  package's version; `components.tui.componentVersion` is the terminal-hub release
  it consumes. They will not match.
- **The TUI's artifact names use `win-x64` / `win-arm64`, not `win32-*`.** Platform
  *keys* stay in Node's namespace (`process.platform` says `win32`); only the
  `filename` crosses over. Never build a TUI URL by interpolating a platform key —
  read `filename` from the lock entry.

## 3. The integrity gate — it will stop you, by design

The SHA-256 check is this package's security boundary, and there is no flag,
env var, or option that relaxes it.

- Bytes are hashed **in memory and compared before anything is written** to the
  cache path. A mismatch raises `IntegrityError` naming expected vs actual and
  leaves nothing on disk.
- A **placeholder hash blocks the fetch before any network call** — between
  releases every `sha256` in the lock is `PENDING-replace-with-real-sha256`, and
  a value that is all zeros or contains `PENDING` (case-insensitive) is treated
  as a placeholder. You get a `PlatformError`, not a download.
- A cache hit **re-hashes the on-disk file**. A cached binary whose bytes drifted
  is re-downloaded, not reused.

If you need to run against a locally built binary, build it and point
`startSidecar` / `runTui` at it directly. The fetcher will not be talked into it.

## 4. Platform coverage — the sidecar has two gaps

`terminal-hub` publishes the TUI for all six targets. The sidecar is a PyInstaller
freeze built on the platform it targets, and there is **no arm64 Linux and no arm64
Windows sidecar build**.

| Platform key   | Sidecar | TUI |
| -------------- | :-----: | :-: |
| `win32-x64`    |   yes   | yes |
| `darwin-arm64` |   yes   | yes |
| `darwin-x64`   |   yes   | yes |
| `linux-x64`    |   yes   | yes |
| `linux-arm64`  | **no**  | yes |
| `win32-arm64`  | **no**  | yes |

Resolving the sidecar on those two keys raises `PlatformError` naming the
platform and the supported set. It is not silently skipped, and the TUI is never
launched with no agent behind it. `npx @amd-gaia/gaia version` prints the matrix
for the version you have.

## 5. Prerequisite — a local Lemonade server

The agent thinks with a model hosted by **Lemonade Server**, which this package
does not install. Required before any query succeeds:

1. Lemonade **10.2.0 or newer**, running (`lemonade-server serve`).
2. The default model downloaded (`gaia download Gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF`, or
   `gaia init`).

Do not guess — ask the sidecar. `GET /v1/gaia/init` is a read-only preflight
(it never pulls or loads) that probes Lemonade, compares its version to the
floor, and checks the model is present:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8141/v1/gaia/init
```

It answers **200** when ready and **503** when not, with the **same body shape
either way** — so branch on `.ready` and render `.hint`, never on the status code
alone:

```jsonc
{
  "ready": false,
  "lemonade": { "reachable": false, "base_url": "…", "version": null,
                "min_version": "10.2.0", "compatible": null },
  "model":    { "id": "Gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF", "present": false,
                "loadable": null, "ctx_size": null },
  "hint": "Local Lemonade Server is not reachable at … — start it with `lemonade-server serve`, or set LEMONADE_BASE_URL to a running server."
}
```

`lemonade.compatible: null` is **indeterminate**, not a pass — the version could
not be parsed. Render it as unknown.

`GET /health` is liveness only. A green `/health` means the REST surface is up;
it says nothing about whether a query will work.

## 6. Start the sidecar

```ts
import { fetchAll, startSidecar, shutdown } from "@amd-gaia/gaia";

// Fetch + SHA-256 verify both binaries. Build step, not per request.
const { sidecar, tui } = await fetchAll();

// Spawn -> poll /health -> check the contract apiVersion, in one call.
const proc = await startSidecar({ binaryPath: sidecar.binaryPath });  // port 8141

// ... drive proc.baseUrl ...

await shutdown(proc);   // tree-kill; auto-cleanup also reaps on exit
```

- `fetchAll(opts?)` returns `{ sidecar, tui, lock }`. Each result carries
  `binaryPath`, `platformKey`, `sha256`, `cached`, `url`. For one component use
  `fetchBinary({ component: "sidecar" | "tui", outDir })`.
- `startSidecar` throws if the binary can't start, never becomes healthy
  (`HealthTimeoutError`, 60 s default — a cold one-file build unpacks first), or
  reports an `apiVersion` whose **major** differs from this package's
  (`VersionMismatchError`). On any failure it shuts the sidecar down before
  rethrowing, so a failed start never leaks a process.
- **Tree-kill is not optional.** The frozen sidecar spawns a child uvicorn
  process that `child.kill()` on the parent does not reap, which leaves port 8141
  bound. `shutdown` kills the group (POSIX `SIGTERM` to `-pid`, escalating to
  `SIGKILL`; Windows `taskkill /T /F`). `autoCleanup` (default `true`) also reaps
  on `exit`, `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`/`SIGHUP`, `uncaughtException`, and
  `unhandledRejection`. A `SIGKILL` of *your* process is the one case nothing
  in-process can catch.
- **Mint a caller token, or you are running the sidecar unauthenticated.** The
  sidecar requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every `/v1/gaia/*`
  request, and skips the check only when neither token env var is set — dev
  mode, which is what `startSidecar` gives you, because this package mints
  nothing. Loopback binding is not the boundary: this agent has shell and file
  tools. Mint your own and pass it through the `env` option (`StartOptions`
  extends `SpawnOptions`, so it merges over `process.env`):

  ```ts
  import { randomBytes } from "node:crypto";
  const token = randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
  const proc = await startSidecar({
    binaryPath: sidecar.binaryPath,
    env: { GAIA_GAIA_SIDECAR_TOKEN: token },   // or ..._TOKEN_FILE, a 0600 path
  });
  ```

  Then send `authorization: "Bearer " + token` on every `/v1/gaia/*` call.
  `/health`, `/version`, and `/v1/gaia/version` are exempt, so `startSidecar`'s
  own health-and-version handshake works either way. **If you did not spawn the
  sidecar** — you are talking to one the GAIA daemon started — the token is the
  daemon's, delivered to the sidecar as `GAIA_GAIA_SIDECAR_TOKEN_FILE` (a `0600`
  file path); read it from there, don't invent one. A 401 whose `detail` names
  both env vars means you sent the wrong token or none.

Or skip the code entirely and let the CLI own it:

```bash
npx @amd-gaia/gaia serve --port 8141
curl http://127.0.0.1:8141/health
```

## 7. Call `POST /v1/gaia/query`

This is the whole agent surface. There is **no typed query client** in this
package — call it with plain `fetch`. Contract version **2.13**; the stream is
`text/event-stream` terminated by **exactly one** `final` or `error`.

Request body (`extra: "forbid"` — an unknown field is a **422**, not ignored):

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `query` | yes | Non-empty. |
| `run_id` | yes | **You mint it**, and it must be a UUID (non-UUID → 422). It is the cancel handle, valid from the instant the request is sent. |
| `context` | yes | Transcript slice, pushed in the body — may be `[]`, never absent. Each item `{ role, content }`; `role` ∈ `user` / `assistant` / `system` / `tool`. |
| `session_id` | no | Contract ≥ 2.12. **Pass it.** The agent persists its indexed-document set per session — without it, it forgets a document between the turn that indexed it and the next question. |
| `can_answer_questions` | no | Set `false` for one-shot / batch runs so the agent resolves ambiguity itself instead of parking on a question nobody can see. |
| `model` | no | Overrides the model id — only when the run builds a fresh agent. On a retained `session_id` the agent already exists, so a model that differs from the one it was built with is a **409**, not an override. |
| `provider` | no | Local inference only — anything but `"lemonade"` is a **400**. |
| `max_steps` | no | ≥ 1. |

```ts
import { randomUUID } from "node:crypto";

const runId = randomUUID();
const res = await fetch(`${proc.baseUrl}/v1/gaia/query`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "content-type": "application/json",
    accept: "text/event-stream",
    authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,   // required unless the sidecar is in dev mode — §6
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "Summarize the PDFs in ~/Documents/reports",
    run_id: runId,
    context: [],
    session_id: "s1",
    can_answer_questions: false,
  }),
});

const reader = res.body!.getReader();
const dec = new TextDecoder();
let buf = "";
outer: for (;;) {
  const { value, done } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  buf += dec.decode(value, { stream: true });
  let i: number;
  while ((i = buf.indexOf("\n\n")) >= 0) {
    const frame = buf.slice(0, i);
    buf = buf.slice(i + 2);
    const line = frame.split("\n").find((l) => l.startsWith("data: "));
    if (!line) continue;                  // ":" frames are keepalive comments
    const ev = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));
    switch (ev.type) {
      case "status":      console.log(ev.message); break;
      case "token":       process.stdout.write(ev.delta); break;
      case "tool_call":   console.log(`→ ${ev.tool}`, ev.args); break;
      case "tool_result": console.log(`← ${ev.tool}`, ev.data); break;
      case "needs_confirmation": break;   // see §8 — a refusal follows
      case "needs_input": /* answer it — see below */ break;
      case "final":       console.log(ev.answer); break outer;   // terminal
      case "error":       console.error(ev.detail); break outer; // terminal
      default:            console.warn("unsupported event", ev); // future additive type
    }
  }
}
```

The canonical event shapes, as emitted:

| Event | Shape |
|---|---|
| `status` | `{ type, message }` — progress and reasoning narration |
| `token` | `{ type, delta }` — answer text to append |
| `tool_call` | `{ type, tool, args }` |
| `tool_result` | `{ type, tool, data, render? }` |
| `needs_confirmation` | `{ type, run_id, action, summary }` — no `confirm_url`; see §8 |
| `needs_input` | `{ type, run_id, request_id, question, options[], allow_free_text, sensitive, respond_url, timeout_seconds? }` |
| `final` | `{ type, answer, usage? }` — terminal |
| `error` | `{ type, detail, status }` — terminal, surface `detail` verbatim |

Rules a client must respect:

- **An idle run emits `: keepalive` SSE comments every 10 s.** Skip lines that
  aren't `data:` and reset your read-idle timer on them — a long tool call is not
  a dead stream.
- **Never treat stream close without a terminal event as success.** The server
  guarantees one; a close without one means something broke on your side.
- **Answer `needs_input`, don't restart.** The run is parked on the *same*
  stream. `POST /v1/gaia/query/{run_id}/respond` with
  `{ request_id, response }` and keep reading the existing stream — a fresh
  `/query` POST abandons the paused run. Unknown run → **404**; a `request_id` that
  is no longer pending → **409** (both loud, never a silent drop). Render each
  option's `description`, and mask the input when `sensitive` is set.
- **Cancel with `POST /v1/gaia/query/{run_id}/cancel`.** It returns
  `{ run_id, cancelled }` — an unknown id reports `cancelled: false` with a
  **200**, not a 404, because a cancel racing a normal completion is expected.
  Dropping the HTTP connection also cancels the run.

## 8. Over `/v1/gaia/query`, confirmation-gated tools are **refused, not prompted**

Read this before you design a workflow around it. This section is about the HTTP
surface — the agent's other transport can collect an approval; see SPEC §5.5.

Ten of the agent's tools mutate the machine and need explicit approval
before they run. Six sit in the base `TOOLS_REQUIRING_CONFIRMATION` set —
**`write_file`**, **`edit_file`**, **`run_shell_command`**,
**`execute_python_file`**, **`run_python`**, and **`notify_desktop`**, which
spawns a PowerShell child on Windows to draw the notification — and the
flagship adds four of its own (`CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED_TOOLS`):
**`install_skill`**, **`capture_skill`**, and **`remove_skill`**, because
installing or capturing a skill writes third-party content under
`~/.gaia/skills` and removing one deletes it, and **`clone_repo`**, because it
downloads a third-party repository into `~/.gaia/workspaces`. A capture that does land is
additionally **code-inert**: its instructions load, but any `tools.py`/scripts
stay unregistered until a human runs `gaia skill promote <name>` in a
terminal. Everything else — reading, indexing, querying, web fetching,
memory — runs without asking.

Over `/v1/gaia/query` there is **no way to collect an approval**, so the stream
does not prompt. When the agent reaches one of those tools it emits a
`needs_confirmation` event, and the server **immediately follows it with a
terminal `final`** whose `answer` says it stopped before running that action,
then cancels the run. There is no `confirm_url`, no resume, and no
`/query/{run_id}/confirm` endpoint — it is a deliberate deny-by-default stub, not
an oversight.

Concretely, your client sees:

```
data: {"type":"needs_confirmation","run_id":"…","action":"write_file","summary":"Run 'write_file'?"}
data: {"type":"final","answer":"I stopped before running 'write_file' because it needs your explicit approval, and this streaming surface cannot collect that yet. …"}
```

So: **`/query` cannot run any of those ten tools.** If your integration needs
that, drive the agent from a surface that can prompt — its stdio transport is the
one that can, because its control channel carries an approval back to a turn
already in flight (SPEC §5.5) — or perform the mutation yourself from your own
code and let the agent do the reading and reasoning. Treat `needs_confirmation`
as an early warning that the run is about to end, not as a question you can
answer.

## 9. File-access scope

The agent's file, document, and data tools are confined to a set of allowed
paths, and **the default is the user's home directory**. That is the honest scope
for a personal document agent, and it is still a real boundary — system
directories, program files, and other users' homes are refused, with the check
run against the *resolved* path so a symlink out of scope doesn't slip through.

**Being in scope is not the same as being safe, and two denylists apply inside
it.** Reads refuse secrets — `.env`, `id_rsa`, `credentials.json`, `.netrc`,
`.pem`/`.key`, and everything under `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.kube` —
even in an allowed directory. Writes additionally refuse anything that executes
on its own: shell startup files, PowerShell profiles, `~/.config/autostart/*`,
systemd user units, `LaunchAgents`, and a repo's `.git/` (hooks and config). Both
come back as a structured error naming the file and the reason, so do not plan an
integration around reading a credential file or editing a shell rc — perform
those from your own code.

The agent also gets its own scratch directory for throwaway scripts and
intermediate files, so they stay out of the user's project. It is created per
agent under the system temp dir, deleted when the agent closes, and is the only
part of the temp dir the agent may use.

**In 0.1.1 narrowing it is a construction-time setting only.** The packaged
sidecar exposes no flag or env var for `allowed_paths` (its CLI accepts only
`--host` and `--port`), so restricting the scope means embedding `GaiaAgent` in
your own Python process:

```python
from gaia_agent.agent import GaiaAgent, GaiaAgentConfig

agent = GaiaAgent(config=GaiaAgentConfig(allowed_paths=["/home/me/Documents"]))
```

## 10. Skills — one always-on, the rest opt-in

The agent is built to host **Agent Skills** (short playbooks loaded into its own
prompt, grouped into named sets, one set active per launch), and its bundled
skill directory is the highest-precedence discovery root.

Loaded skills are **not** all resident every turn: each turn the agent embeds
the query against every loaded skill's description and renders only the
matching bodies in full — the rest collapse to a one-line menu entry, and the
model (or the user) re-activates one by calling `load_skill` on it again.
`GAIA_DYNAMIC_SKILLS=0` disables the per-turn selection (every loaded body
renders every turn); `GAIA_DYNAMIC_SKILLS_TAU=<float>` overrides the match
threshold. Manifest `skills:` entries are always-on and never collapse. If the
embedder is unavailable, selection disables itself for the session and every
body renders — capability is never silently lost to a failed match.

**One skill ships enabled: `gaia-voice`.** It is a manifest `skills:` entry, so
it is always on, always rendered in full, and paid on every LLM call of every
turn — budget for it. It is not a task recipe but the agent's honesty floor: do
not claim work you did not do, do not present empty output as a result, do not
substitute a near-miss and report success. Those failures corrupt an answer
whatever the task is, which is why it cannot live in an opt-in bundle. It
declares no tools, and its body measures 676 tokens (tiktoken `cl100k`).

**No skill *set* loads.** `gaia-agent.yaml` ships its `skill_sets:` and
`default_skill_set:` blocks **commented out** — following the email agent's
precedent, because loading several skill bodies into every prompt costs tokens
and no eval has measured that trade for this agent yet. Re-enabling is
uncommenting two blocks; no code change.

So today there is nothing for `GAIA_SKILL_SET` to select — leave it unset. Once
a release declares sets, `GAIA_SKILL_SET` is the selection channel for the
packaged sidecar (its CLI accepts only `--host` and `--port`), and an undeclared
name raises naming the valid sets rather than falling back to a default. Beyond
`gaia-voice`, do not design around a skill being on by default.

## 11. The project map — two things it costs you

When the agent's working directory is a code repository, every task starts with
a **project map** in the system prompt: the root, the directory shape, the
likely entry points, which commands are installed, and the three platform
differences that change command syntax. It exists so the agent stops burning
round trips on "no such file" and "command not found".

Two consequences an integrator needs to plan for:

- **Up to 600 prompt tokens, every turn.** That is the enforced ceiling
  (1.8% of the NPU profile's 32K window), not a typical value — budget it
  alongside `gaia-voice`'s 676.
- **A background embedding pass on first contact with a new repository.** If
  the repo has no [code index](https://amd-gaia.ai/docs/guides/code-index), the
  map starts one in a background thread so semantic search is ready when it is
  needed. On a large monorepo that is minutes of local embedding.
  `GAIA_PROJECT_MAP_AUTO_INDEX=0` turns it off.

The sidecar's CLI accepts only `--host` and `--port`, so pointing the map at a
specific project means `GAIA_PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/repo` in its environment, or
`GaiaAgentConfig(project_root=...)` when embedding. A directory that is neither
a VCS checkout nor holds a recognised manifest gets **no map** — that is the
designed answer, not a failure.

## 12. Ports

| Service | Port |
|---|---|
| Agent sidecar | `8141` on `127.0.0.1` |
| GAIA daemon | assigned at start, recorded in `~/.gaia/host/instance.json` |

Port **4001 is reserved repo-wide**: `spawnSidecar` throws a `RangeError` and
`gaia serve --port 4001` exits 2. Both services bind loopback only — this agent
speaks for the user's documents and memory and has no business on a LAN
interface.

## 13. Running in a server or long-lived app

- **`fetchAll` / `fetchBinary` are a build step**, not per request — network plus
  a full SHA-256 hash of a large artifact. Run once at install time.
- **`resolveSidecarPath` / `resolveTuiPath` are startup, not per request.** They
  re-hash the binary against `binaries.lock.json` before handing back a path that
  gets spawned, so they cost a full read of a large file. Resolve once and keep
  the path. `{ verify: false }` skips the check for a binary you built yourself.
- **Spawn once at boot** and hold the `Sidecar` handle for the process lifetime.
  Never per request.
- **Low concurrency.** One local Lemonade model slot, so parallel queries
  serialize. Cap inflight runs.
- **The package does not restart a crashed sidecar.** It reaps one; supervision
  is the daemon's job (or yours).
- **`DEBUG=gaia`** puts download, spawn, and sidecar output on **stderr**. stdout
  belongs to the TUI once exec'd, and to machine-readable JSON for `fetch` /
  `version` — never write diagnostics there.

Every failure throws a typed error extending `GaiaError`, so
`instanceof GaiaError` catches any of ours: `IntegrityError`, `PlatformError`,
`HealthTimeoutError`, `VersionMismatchError`, `BinaryNotFoundError`, `HttpError`.
There is no silent null.

## Gotchas — read before debugging

- **`/health` green ≠ ready.** It never touches the model server. Use
  `GET /v1/gaia/init` and branch on `.ready`; it returns 503 with a full body and
  a `hint`, not an empty error.
- **A terminal `error` whose `detail` starts "Local Lemonade Server is not
  reachable"** means Lemonade isn't running or isn't reachable — not a bug in
  this package. Start it, or set `LEMONADE_BASE_URL`.
- **`needs_confirmation` is followed by a refusal and the run ends.** See §8.
  The nine gated tools are unreachable **over `/query`** — the agent itself can
  run them on a transport that can prompt (SPEC §5.5).
- **A placeholder hash in `binaries.lock.json` blocks the fetch before any
  network call.** Between releases that is the *expected* state — it is not a
  broken install, and there is no override.
- **No `linux-arm64` / `win32-arm64` sidecar.** The TUI has both. A `PlatformError`
  on those hosts is the design, not a missing artifact.
- **A `401` from `/v1/gaia/*` is the caller-auth token, not a bug.** The sidecar
  requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; `/health`, `/version`, and
  `/v1/gaia/version` are exempt, which is why a green health check sits happily
  in front of a 401 on `/query`. It skips the check only in dev mode — neither
  token env var set — which is what `spawnSidecar` and `gaia serve` produce,
  because this package mints nothing. Do not treat loopback binding as the
  boundary; mint a token and pass it (§6).
- **`run_id` must be a UUID**, and unknown fields in the request body are a
  **422** — the model forbids extras. Typos don't get ignored.
- **`gaia run` needs the *Python* `gaia` CLI on `PATH`** — the TUI shells out to
  it to start the daemon. So the TUI doesn't re-invoke our own npm shim, the
  child's `PATH` is rewritten: a directory holding nothing but our shim (an npx
  temp dir) is dropped, and a **shared** bin directory is moved to the end
  instead of removed, so the `python3` / `lemonade-server` / real `gaia` beside
  it stay reachable. If the Python CLI isn't installed anywhere, the daemon never
  comes up. It must also be **0.23.1+**: an older core's daemon starts fine but
  has no sidecar entry for this agent, which reads as a UI with a dead agent
  rather than as a version problem.
- **The TUI is installed as `gaia-tui`, never `gaia`** — the terminal-hub artifact
  *is* called `gaia-<platform>`, and a file named `gaia` in a cache directory would
  shadow the npm bin shim. The lock's `filename` and `executable` differ for that
  reason. Don't rename it back.
- **The TUI comes from a lane this package doesn't publish.** If a fetch 404s on
  the TUI but not the sidecar, the pinned `terminal-hub` version is the thing to
  check — `gaia version` prints it and its base URL.
- **ESM-only.** `require("@amd-gaia/gaia")` fails; use `import` or dynamic
  `import()`.

## Verify the integration

Green path, in order:

```bash
npx @amd-gaia/gaia version          # per-component version + source URL + matrix
npx @amd-gaia/gaia fetch            # JSON: one entry per binary with its sha256
npx @amd-gaia/gaia serve --port 8141
```

Against a lock that still carries `PENDING-…` hashes, `fetch` is *expected* to
fail with a `PlatformError` before any download — that is the gate working, not a
broken install. Only a published release has real hashes.

Then, in another terminal:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8141/health          # {"status":"ok","service":"gaia-agent-gaia"}
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8141/version         # {"apiVersion":"2.13","agentVersion":"0.1.1"}
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8141/v1/gaia/init    # 200 + "ready":true, or 503 + a "hint"
curl -N -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8141/v1/gaia/query \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"What can you do?","run_id":"00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001","context":[],"can_answer_questions":false}'
```

A healthy run streams `status` / `token` events and ends with one `final`. If
`/v1/gaia/init` is 503, fix what its `hint` names and retry — the rest of your
integration is fine.

That `/query` call carries no `Authorization` header because `gaia serve` starts
the sidecar in dev mode. Against one started with a token, add
`-H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"` — a **401** here and a green `/health` is
that and nothing else (§6).

**A 503 from `/query` itself is a different condition**: every retained
session slot is busy and none is idle enough to evict (SPEC §5.2). Do NOT
loop on `/v1/gaia/init` — it will report ready. Wait for a running turn to
finish (or close an idle session) and retry the same `/query`.

**Three more refusals are yours to avoid**, each naming its fix in `detail`
(SPEC §5.2 has the reasoning):

- **409 — the `run_id` is still in flight.** You mint it, so mint a fresh UUID
  per request; reusing one would leave the earlier run with no way to be
  cancelled.
- **409 — `model` differs from what this `session_id` was built with.** Only
  construction reads a model, so it cannot be applied to the retained agent.
  Omit `model` to stay on the session's current one, or start a new
  `session_id` to switch.
- **400 — the `Host` header is absent or empty.** The loopback check fails
  closed, so omitting the header is refused rather than served. Send
  `Host: 127.0.0.1:<port>`; every real HTTP client already does.

## TUI inference providers

The stdio TUI supports `/provider` for Local, Fireworks AI, and AMD LLM Gateway.
Keys are entered in a masked field and sent directly to local Lemonade's runtime
auth API, never as agent queries. `/model` lists supported discovered cloud and
downloaded local models; `/model fireworks.gemma-4-31b-it` selects Gemma 4 31B IT
when available. Cloud chat sends conversation history to the selected provider;
embeddings remain on Lemonade. The status event names the actual provider and
marks remote inference. This is a TUI/stdio capability, not an HTTP query command.
