"""CORE + bundle definitions for the ChatAgent tool loader (#1449).

One ``DOC_*`` / ``FULL_*`` pair per profile that supports dynamic tool loading,
wired together by :data:`PROFILE_TOOL_CONFIGS`. CORE is the small always-on set
(cap- and eviction-exempt); bundles are cohesion groups pulled in whole when any
member is semantically matched.

A profile's ``CORE`` ∪ all its bundle members must equal that profile's registry
**exactly**. The drift guard is the CI test
``tests/unit/test_chat_tool_bundles.py`` — it compares both sets and fails the
build if a registry tool is uncovered *or* a configured name is absent, so a new
tool forces a conscious bundling decision instead of silently shipping
unselected. At runtime, ``ToolLoader.validate_registry`` (called once on first
``select``) additionally fails loudly if any CORE/bundle name is missing from the
registry — minus the profile's declared ``optional`` names, which are absent by
construction on some installs (see :data:`FULL_OPTIONAL_TOOLS`).

# -- "full" profile (the flagship GaiaAgent) ---------------------------------
#
# Same contract as the DOC_* pair above, sized for the ``full`` registry: 66
# tools instead of 37, so the un-trimmed native ``tools=`` payload costs ~10.2K
# tiktoken tokens on every LLM call of a 2-5 call ReAct turn.
#
# Always-on set (15 tools). Deliberately a smaller share of the registry than
# the doc CORE, because a general-purpose agent has no single reason to exist:
# memory (recall is relevant to every turn), loop control (protocol-level turn
# signalling), the ``load_tools`` escape hatch, ``read_tool_output`` to page
# through a result that was cut short, ``load_skill`` for proactive
# skill discovery, two universal entry points -- ``read_file`` and
# ``query_documents`` -- that answer "what is in this file / what do my
# documents say" without a round trip, ``run_python`` so a number is computed
# rather than guessed, and the two file-edit tools. Editing is
# always on because semantic selection cannot rank it: on explicit edit
# requests the edit tools lost the dynamic slots to unrelated bundles (#3752).
# Everything else, shell and the web included, is a bundle: it arrives when the
# turn asks for it. ``query_documents`` is a bundle member too, so a
# document-shaped turn pulls its whole cohort in with it; the ``file_edit``
# cohort is now entirely CORE.

# Bundle members a healthy ``full`` registry may legitimately lack. Handed to
# ToolLoader as ``optional_tools`` so ``validate_registry`` tolerates exactly

# reasons, not "it might be missing, who knows":
#
# 1. Environment-conditional registration -- ``search_documentation`` needs npx
#    on PATH; ChatAgent skips it rather than register a tool whose backend
#    always fails. (``search_web`` is NOT optional here: the browser mixin
#    registers it unconditionally for this profile.)
# 2. Subclass-provided mixins -- the skill-library, skill-learning,
#    code-index, and git workspace tools come from GaiaAgent, so a plain ChatAgent on
#    prompt_profile="full" has none.
# 3. Memory. MemoryMixin registers nothing when the embedder is unreachable, so
#    a degraded-but-running agent has a store and no memory tools. Selection
#    already skips CORE names absent from the registry; without this, validation
#    turned that survivable state into a hard ValueError on the first turn.
# 4. Config-gated registration -- the SD tools register only under
#    ``enable_sd_tools``, which only GaiaAgentConfig turns on.
#
# The CI drift guard checks the other direction against the flagship registry,
# where every one of these IS present, so a rename still fails the build.
