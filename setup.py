# Standalone AMD production agent wheels (issues #1102, #1179). Each ships as
# a separate 'gaia-agent-<id>' PyPI package depending on this framework
# wheel. Deliberately NOT an extras_require entry: this list is read
# statically by util/list_agent_packages.py (single source of truth for
# .github/workflows/publish_agents.yml's build/publish matrix and
# tests/unit/test_agent_pypi_publish.py) without ever being handed to pip's
# resolver. An extras_require entry naming these packages made 'pip install
# "amd-gaia[agents]"' unsatisfiable while the wheels are unpublished
# (publish_agents.yml's publish job is paused), which made the resolver
# silently downgrade amd-gaia itself to the newest release that didn't
# declare the extra (#2240) -- see setup.py history / PR fixing #2240 for
# the incident. Do not move this back into extras_require until the wheels
# are live on PyPI.
